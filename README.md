**Resolution of the first individual homework for ADM class**

The solutions of the homework are stored in two main places:  
1. A folder named **'stamps'** which contains different pdf files. 

   * Each file contains the screenshoots, from the submission page of Hackerrank, of a specific section of excercises. I took the screenshoots one by one and reordered them inside the pdf file because, when I solved them, I didn't follow the right order. So, if I took the screenshot from the *'submission page'* directly, I would have had all the excercises from different sections mixed. 
   * The name of each file indicates which section is referring to.
    
2. A file called **scripts** which is a Jupyter Notebook that I created.

   * Inside the notebook, each cell corresponds to a specific excercise. At the top of each cell I commented the name of the excercise. 
   * All exercises are sorted by the section they belong to. I also specified the name of each subsection with the help of markdown cells
